A high-performance, single-file application data format using C#, SQLite (Microsoft.Data.Sqlite), and Dapper.

# Core Architecture

## Primary Format
A single SQLite .db file acting as an "Application File Format".

## Data Storage Strategy
Treat SQLite as a hybrid relational/document store. JSON data is stored in **JSONB format** (binary JSON introduced in SQLite 3.45+) for optimal storage efficiency and query performance.

## Data Access Layer
Use Dapper for next-to-zero mapping overhead.

## Custom Logic
Automatic JSON serialization/deserialization of C# objects into SQLite BLOB columns using JSONB format.

## Performance Requirements
- Minimize System Calls: The design must utilize SQLite's ability to be up to 35% faster than raw file I/O for small blobs by reducing open() and close() operations.
- Transaction Batching: Writes should be grouped into transactions to maintain high write speed.
- Async Operations: All database operations are async for optimal performance and scalability.
- JSONB Format: Uses SQLite's JSONB format for binary-optimized JSON storage to eliminate repetitive parsing overhead.

## Configuration
The library defaults to WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode and synchronous = NORMAL for optimal balance between safety and performance.

# Usage

## Installation

Build the project:
```bash
dotnet build
```

## Requirements

- .NET 10
- SQLite 3.45+ (for JSONB support)

## Features

- ✅ **Generic Repository Pattern**: Type-safe CRUD operations with automatic table naming
- ✅ **Async/Await**: All database operations are fully async
- ✅ **JSONB Format**: Uses SQLite 3.45+ JSONB for binary-optimized JSON storage
- ✅ **Virtual Columns**: Index JSON properties for up to 1,300x faster queries
- ✅ **Transaction Support**: Batch operations for high-performance writes
- ✅ **WAL Mode**: Automatically configured for optimal concurrency
- ✅ **Zero SQL Injection Risk**: Table names derived from types, not user input
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- ✅ **.NET 10**: Built on the latest .NET platform
- ✅ **Comprehensive Tests**: Unit and integration tests with xUnit

## Dependencies

- .NET 10
- Dapper
- Microsoft.Data.Sqlite

## JSONB Storage Benefits

The library uses SQLite's JSONB functions introduced in version 3.45+:
- More compact storage (binary format)
- Faster queries on JSON data
- Reduced parsing overhead
- Compatible with SQLite's JSON functions

## CI/CD
