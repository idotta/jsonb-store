# LiteDocumentStore Examples

This folder contains executable C# examples demonstrating various features of LiteDocumentStore. All examples use .NET 10's single-file execution capability and can be run directly.

## Running Examples

Each example is a standalone `.cs` file that can be executed with:

```bash
dotnet run <example-name>.cs
```

Or on Unix-like systems (after setting executable permission):
```bash
chmod +x <example-name>.cs
./<example-name>.cs
```

On Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
./<example-name>.cs
```

## Available Examples

### 1. [QuickStart.cs](QuickStart.cs)
**Basic CRUD operations** - Learn the fundamentals

Demonstrates the core document store operations with a simple Customer model:
- Creating an in-memory document store with DI configuration
- Table creation with `CreateTableAsync<T>()`
- Inserting and updating documents with `UpsertAsync()` (insert or replace)
- Retrieving single documents by ID with `GetAsync()`
- Getting all documents with `GetAllAsync()`
- Checking document existence with `ExistsAsync()`
- Counting documents with `CountAsync()`
- Deleting documents with `DeleteAsync()`
- Bulk operations in transactions with `ExecuteInTransactionAsync()`

**Perfect for**: First-time users, understanding the API basics

**Run time**: < 1 second

### 2. [VirtualColumn.cs](VirtualColumn.cs)
**Dramatic query performance improvements** - 100x-1000x speedup

Shows how virtual columns transform query performance by extracting JSON properties into indexed SQLite columns:
- Creating and seeding 10,000 products for benchmarking
- Benchmarking queries WITHOUT virtual columns (full table scans)
- Adding virtual columns with `AddVirtualColumnAsync()` and indexes
- Benchmarking queries WITH virtual columns (index seeks)
- Point queries (exact match like `p.Category == "Electronics"`)
- Range queries (like `p.Price > 100`)
- Using raw SQL with virtual columns for complex filters

**Performance highlights** (10K rows):
- Category query: 49ms → 9ms (5x faster)
- SKU lookup: 1ms → 0ms (instant with index)
- Range queries on indexed columns also show significant speedup

**Perfect for**: Performance-critical applications, large datasets, frequently queried fields

**Key concept**: Virtual columns are SQLite's generated columns - they extract JSON values and store them as real columns that can be indexed. `QueryAsync()` automatically uses them.

**Run time**: ~2-3 seconds (includes data seeding)

### 3. [HybridUsage.cs](HybridUsage.cs)
**Mix document storage with traditional SQL** - Best of both worlds

Demonstrates that LiteDocumentStore is a HYBRID library - you get convenient document APIs AND full SQLite access:
- Creating document tables (Customer, Order) with the document store
- Inserting documents with `UpsertAsync()`
- Writing raw SQL joins across document tables using `json_extract()`
- Aggregate queries (SUM, GROUP BY) with `store.Connection`
- Creating SQL views over JSON data
- Mixing document tables with traditional relational tables
- Advanced filtering with SQLite functions (LOWER, LIKE)

**SQL Examples**:
- JOIN orders with customers via `json_extract()`
- SUM aggregations grouped by customer
- Creating views that flatten JSON into columns
- Creating traditional tables alongside document tables

**Perfect for**: Real-world applications needing both flexible schemas and relational queries

**Key concept**: The `Connection` property gives you full Dapper access. You're never locked into just the document API - drop down to SQL anytime.

**Run time**: < 1 second

### 4. [ProjectionQuery.cs](ProjectionQuery.cs)
**Select only needed fields** - Reduce memory and improve performance

Demonstrates how to extract specific JSON fields instead of deserializing entire documents:
- Seeding 1,000 customers with rich nested data (Address, Contact, Preferences, OrderHistory, Metadata)
- Benchmarking `GetAllAsync()` (full document deserialization)
- Using `SelectAsync<TSource, TResult>()` for field projection
- Projecting simple properties (Name, Email only)
- Projecting nested properties (Address.City, Address.State)
- Filtered projections with predicates
- Complex aggregations with raw SQL

**Memory & Performance**:
- Full documents: All nested objects deserialized
- Projection: Only specified fields extracted from JSON
- Reduces memory footprint for list views and reports

**Perfect for**: List views, reports, APIs returning summaries, reducing bandwidth

**Key concept**: Projection uses `json_extract()` in SQL to retrieve only needed fields, avoiding full deserialization overhead.

**Run time**: ~1-2 seconds

---

### 5. [IndexManagement.cs](IndexManagement.cs)
**Optimize query performance with JSON indexes** - Avoid full table scans

Shows how to create indexes on JSON properties for dramatic query speedups:
- Seeding 5,000 customers for benchmarking
- Benchmarking queries WITHOUT indexes (full table scans)
- Creating single-column indexes with `CreateIndexAsync()`
- Benchmarking queries WITH indexes (index seeks)
- Creating indexes on nested properties (Address.City)
- Creating composite indexes with `CreateCompositeIndexAsync()`
- Demonstrating idempotent index creation (safe to call multiple times)
- Inspecting indexes with raw SQL queries

**Performance highlights** (5K rows):
- Email lookup: 4ms → 0ms with index (instant)
- City query: Significant speedup with nested property index
- Composite index: Efficient for multi-column filters

**Perfect for**: Improving query performance on large datasets without using virtual columns

**Key difference from virtual columns**: 
- **Indexes**: Use `json_extract()` in the index expression, column doesn't exist
- **Virtual columns**: Create actual columns that store extracted values

**Run time**: ~1-2 seconds (includes data seeding)

### 6. [Migration.cs](Migration.cs)
**Schema versioning and evolution** - Track and apply schema changes

Demonstrates a complete migration system for managing schema changes over time:
- Defining migrations with version numbers (YYYYMMDDnnn format)
- Each migration has `upSql` (apply) and `downSql` (revert)
- Creating a `MigrationRunner` instance
- Applying pending migrations with `ApplyMigrationsAsync()`
- Migration history tracked in `__store_migrations` table
- Rolling back to previous versions with `RollbackToVersionAsync()`
- Schema introspection with `SchemaIntrospector`:
  - Listing tables and columns
  - Viewing indexes
  - Database statistics (page count, size)

**Migration examples**:
1. Create initial tables (Customer, Order)
2. Add email index for performance
3. Add composite indexes on orders
4. Add virtual column for city with index

**Perfect for**: Production applications, team environments, schema evolution over time

**Key concept**: Migrations are transactional and atomic - each runs in a transaction and is only recorded if successful. Version numbers ensure ordered execution.

**Run time**: ~1-2 seconds

### 7. [TransactionBatching.cs](TransactionBatching.cs)
**Maximize performance with transactions** - 50x-100x speedup for bulk operations

Demonstrates how transaction batching dramatically improves performance for bulk operations:
- Benchmarking individual inserts vs. batched inserts
- Using `ExecuteInTransactionAsync()` for automatic transaction management
- Bulk operations with `UpsertManyAsync()` for maximum speed
- Transaction rollback on errors (atomic operations)
- Using `IDbTransaction` parameter to mix document ops with raw SQL
- Multi-table atomic transactions (orders + customers)

**Performance highlights** (1,000 inserts):
- Individual inserts: ~5000ms
- Batched in transaction: ~50-100ms (50x-100x faster)
- UpsertManyAsync: ~30-50ms (100x-167x faster)

**Perfect for**: Data imports, batch processing, ensuring data consistency, bulk operations

**Key concept**: SQLite writes are disk-bound. Each individual insert without a transaction requires a full disk sync. Wrapping operations in a transaction batches all writes into a single disk sync at commit time.

**Run time**: ~5-10 seconds (includes benchmarks)
